# Interactive World Population Dashboard

## Introduction
This project presents an **interactive visualization of world population data** using Python, Plotly, and Altair.  
The goal was to explore global population trends, identify the top 20 most populous countries, and create an accessible, interactive portfolio to showcase analytical and visualization skills.

## Problem / Objective
- Understand global population distribution
- Highlight top 20 most populous countries
- Create an interactive dashboard for easy exploration

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for data analysis  
- **Plotly** for interactive visualizations  
- **Altair** for dynamic charts  
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting interactive dashboards

## Data Preparation
- Data was cleaned and filtered to focus on relevant years and countries  
- Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand trends  
- Top 20 countries by population were selected for most visualizations

## Interactive Visualizations

- **Population Distribution (Altair Chart)**  
  👉 [View Distribution](population_distribution.html)

- **Full Population Dashboard**  
  👉 [View Full Dashboard](population_dashboard.html)

## Challenges
- Some HTML files were very large, making GitHub preview unavailable  
- Fixed by exporting charts with `include_plotlyjs="cdn"` (Plotly) and filtering Altair data  
- All visuals now work fully interactively via **GitHub Pages**

## Outcome & Insights
- Successfully created an interactive, multi-chart dashboard  
- Users can explore top countries by population across different years  
- Highlighted trends such as rapid population growth in specific countries  
- Demonstrates ability to clean, explore, visualize data, and deploy interactive dashboards

## How to View
All visuals are hosted live via GitHub Pages:
